# German-words-thing
mini project to help me learn german words better

this project contains 2 notepads of words which are just letters (i'm lazy and don't want to type in all the words yet)
there is also a 3rd notepad which contains insults to which shame you for being a dumb fuck

NOTE: all inputs are to be in lower case otherwise the code wont work

steps are as follow 

1 input whether you would like to begin or not by typing either ( yes ) or ( no )

2 input how many words you would like to revise ( currently there are 5 to choose from )

3a the console will ask you if you know the word and you should respond as it indicates ( 1 = yes ) ( 2 = no )

3b if entered 2 you will be insulted and told the word to learn

4a if entered 1 you will need to enter the words translation ( for ease of access it is a direct mirror so a == a )

4b if word is correct then the number of words learned will decrease by 1

4c if word is incorrect there will be no change in the number of words to learn and you will be insulted

5 once you have 'learned' the words, the console will ask you if you want to go again ( yes or no option )

6a if yes is entered repeat steps again

6b if no is entered you will be asked for confirmation to leave ( yes or no )

7a if confirmation is yes then it runs quit()

7b if confirmation is no then the start menu will appear


( the insults can be quite harsh but they are meant for myself so sorry if you are offended )
